# A simple Computer Vision project for playing Rock, Paper and Scissors. 

## Creating the model 

The model for the project was created using the Teachable-Machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) by Google.
The readme file has also been created to document the total flow of this project. 


## Installing the dependencies 

A new virtual environment was created for this project. The environment consists of tensorflow, ipykernel and opencv-python among the other simple python libraries that helps to work on this -- of which are listed and saved in the requirements.txt file in the project folder. 

Also, the model is run in the local machine using a snippet of code presented in the main.ipynb file. This code has been borrowed from Aicore. At the end of the file, a waitKey(1) has been added as without it the window does not seem to close after a key input (i.e. 'q' in this case). (The device I am working on is M1 mac).
